    <h1>"While creating Kane Sports & Physical Therapy it was so important for me to create a business that not only was professional and relaxing, but fit the needs of as many people as possible. That’s why I decided to incorporate being both mobile and having my own premises. I understood that some people wanted to get out of the house for a few hours and prefer being in professional surroundings, however for others it would be easier for me to come to them as they may work late or be single parents and not have time to come to me! That’s ultimately what led me to the decision to bring the two together."</h1>
